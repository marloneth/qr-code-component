## My process

1. I started watching both designs (desktop and mobile) and I could see that the position or sizes in the elements don't changed, so I decided to use fixed sizes for the elements.

2. I started my dev process with the structure (HTML code) using the correct tags to have a correct semantic in my code.

3. Once I had all the structure, image loaded and texts I started with styles. Fir that I used my own css file.

4. In the process of styling also I had to import the Google font used in the design.

5. Once I was convinced with the view of my implementation, I did some small test with different views (mobile, tablet, desktop) and I could see responsiveness on each view.

6. Then I started writing the documentation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### Continued development

I want to focus my learning on start frontend projects from zero, improve my HTML understanding and be more skilled in Frontend in general.
